# COVID-19 and Longform Twitter

This repository contains the data and analysis for a short COVID-19 data challenge.

We collected tweets containing the terms 'coronavirus' or 'covid19' and searched for *threads*, tweets with 3+ replies from the same author. We then annotated a subject of those threads with thread type. 

A summary of our findings can be found in the pdf of this repository.

Work done by Katy Ilonka Gero, Jennifer Lee, Sarah Huang, and Lydia B. Chilton.
